### Description
 
This project generates a client that allows communication with an XMPP server with the domain @alumchat.xyz, it is programmed in python language and the [slixmpp](https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library is used to implement the main functionalities of the XMPP protocol. This client allows simulating a communication network and sending messages using the flooding, distance vector routing and link state routing algorithms.

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 +
- Slixmpp
- Connecting to a XMPP server to use the client
- Networkx
- Pyyalm
- Asyncio

### How to use

Run from command line as follows:  
                            ```python
